# Stage 1: Planning & Requirement Analysis

## 1.1 Planning Overview
The "Tic-Tac-Toe Web" project is designed to demonstrate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using standard web technologies. The project follows the **Waterfall Model**, ensuring distinct phases for design and implementation before deployment.

## 1.2 Define Project Scope
This section defines the boundaries of the web-based application.

* **In-Scope (What we are building):**
    * A Browser-based Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    * Two-player functionality (local "Hotseat" mode: Player X and O share the mouse/screen).
    * Interactive 3x3 grid using HTML/CSS.
    * Real-time game status updates (e.g., "Player X's Turn", "Winner is O").
    * "Reset Game" button to restart without reloading the page.
    * One-click deployment via GitHub Pages.

* **Out-of-Scope (What we are NOT building yet):**
    * Complex backend or server-side logic (Node.js/Python).
    * Online multiplayer across different devices.
    * AI/Computer opponent.
    * User accounts or login systems.

## 1.3 Objectives & Goals
* **Primary Goal:** To create a visually clean, responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game accessible via a public URL.
* **Technical Goal:** To manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using vanilla JavaScript without external frameworks (like React or Angular).
* **User Experience Goal:** "Zero-friction" playability—users should be able to play immediately upon opening the link.
